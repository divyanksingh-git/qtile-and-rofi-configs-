## Help
Not all of the sheet was edited while making this theme, as I focused more on colour scheme. Found anything which doesn't fit into the theme? Good suggestion for a font? Open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/abbabon/aseprite-dracula-theme/issues/new "New Issue &#183; abbabon/aseprite-dracula-theme") or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abbabon).
